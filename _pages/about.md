Graphs are increasingly used to represent and capture information about interconnected real-world entities. A rich landscape of graph database systems has emerged to efficiently store, process, and analyse complex graph datasets. While these offer limited support for evolution mechanisms, the proliferation of continuously and collaboratively curated graph data has made it imperative to provide principled and tractable mechanisms to define and employ graph transformations and query languages.

Some underlying challenges include the lack of practical formalisms for describing graph transformations and the absence of appropriate syntactic and semantic primitives for capturing and querying various aspects of temporality, such as timeliness or versioning. Moreover, upholding human aspects of graph transformation ecosystems, e.g., interoperability, reliability, scalability, and learning requirements, calls for the design of new models and techniques and for further discussions on the role and use of recent generative AI methods in this setting.
